The\n            default behavior of buck is to do enough work to get a result for the builds of each of\n            `:foo` and `:bar`, and no more. This means that buck will continue to complete the build\n            of `:bar` after the build of `:foo` has failed; however, once one dependency of `:foo`\n            has failed, other dependencies will be cancelled unless they are needed by `:bar`.\n            \n            This flag changes the behavior of buck to not wait on `:bar` to complete once `:foo` has\n            failed. Generally, this flag only has an effect on builds that specify multiple targets.\n            \n            `--keep-going` changes the behavior of buck to not only wait on `:bar` once one\n            dependency of `:foo` has failed, but to additionally attempt to build other dependencies\n            of `:foo` if possible.\n\n        --fake-arch <ARCH>\n            [possible values: default, aarch64, x8664]\n\n        --fake-host <HOST>\n            [possible values: default, linux, macos, windows]\n\n        --fake-xcode-version <VERSION-BUILD>\n            Value must be formatted as: version-build (e.g., 14.3.0-14C18 or 14.1-14B47b)\n\n    -h, --help\n            Print help information\n\n        --include <INCLUDE>...\n            Labels on targets to include from tests.

If remote execution is enabled, the\n            RE service might still deduplicate actions, so for e.g. benchmarking, using a random\n            isolation dir is preferred\n            \n            [env: BUCK_OFFLINE_BUILD=]\n\n        --oncall <ONCALL>\n            The oncall executing this command\n\n        --overall-timeout <TIMEOUT>\n            How long to execute tests for.

Will prefer executing actions that can execute locally on the\n            local host\n\n        --prefer-remote\n            Enable hybrid execution. Will prefer executing actions that can execute remotely on RE\n            and will avoid racing local and remote execution\n\n        --remote-only\n            Enable only remote execution. Will reject actions that cannot execute remotely\n\n        --reuse-current-config\n            Re-uses any `--config` values (inline or via modefiles) if there's a previous command,\n            otherwise the flag is ignored.\n            \n            If there is a previous command and `--reuse-current-config` is set, then the old config\n            is used, ignoring any overrides.\n            \n            If there is no previous command but the flag was set, then the flag is ignored, the\n            command behaves as if the flag was not set at all.\n\n        --skip-incompatible-targets\n            If target is incompatible with the specified configuration, skip building instead of\n            throwing error. This does not apply to targets specified with glob patterns `/...` or\n            `:` which are skipped unconditionally\n\n        --skip-missing-targets\n            If target is missing, then skip building instead of throwing error\n\n        --skip-targets-with-duplicate-names\n            If there are targets with duplicate names in `BUCK` file, skip all the duplicates but\n            the first one. This is a hack for TD. Do not use this option\n\n        --stack\n            Record or show target call stacks.\n            \n            Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.\n            \n            If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be\n            printed after the targets.\n\n        --target-platforms <PLATFORM>\n            Configuration target (one) to use to configure targets\n\n        --test-executor-stderr <TEST_EXECUTOR_STDERR>\n            Writes the test executor stderr to the provided path\n            \n            --test-executor-stderr=- will write to stderr\n            \n            --test-executor-stderr=FILEPATH will write to the provided filepath, overwriting the\n            current file if it exists\n            \n            By default test executor's stderr stream is captured\n\n        --test-executor-stdout <TEST_EXECUTOR_STDOUT>\n            Writes the test executor stdout to the provided path\n            \n            --test-executor-stdout=- will write to stdout\n            \n            --test-executor-stdout=FILEPATH will write to the provided filepath, overwriting the\n            current file if it exists\n            \n            By default the test executor's stdout stream is captured\n\n        --ui <UI>\n            Configure additional superconsole ui components.\n            \n            Accepts a comma-separated list of superconsole components to add.

It's possible that the action result is cached but the action itself has\n            expired. In this case, downloading the action itself would fail.
